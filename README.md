Hello world!
This repository is filled with my favorite work from a course I took for my Creative Technology and Design Minor. 
This course (ATLS 1300) was my first introduction into coding, in this class we learned Python. 
I hope you enjoy looking at my work and seeing the improvement that I made over the semester!
